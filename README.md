This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in HTML when attempting to retrieve text content from a div element using Javascript. The bug arises from the misuse of the innerText property compared to textContent.  The bug.html file shows the incorrect approach, while bugSolution.html provides the corrected version.  The key difference is using textContent instead of innerText for accurate text retrieval, especially when dealing with nested elements or whitespace.
